## Introduction

Urban Loom is a modern clothing store with a React-based online shopping website. Unfortunately, the development team left a few bugs in the application. Your mission is to dive into the code, find the issues, and fix them!

This challenge is designed to test your React skills, your debugging abilities, and your attention to detail.

## Your Task

- Explore the codebase and identify the bugs.
- Solve each issue by fixing the provided components, contexts, or logic.
- Run the provided tests to verify your fixes.
- Push your working code once you have passed all tests.

`Special Note:` The api is from fakestoreapi.com. Check out the docs at https://fakestoreapi.com/docs

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

`Note:` If you see a blank screen when initially running the app, don't worry! This is expected. You will have to create a firebase app and add the configuration variables in the `.env` file. You can find the configuration variables in the `src/firebase.js` file.
